The generation of each level uses a simplex image and a random number generator.

Generation process :
	Floor :
		Fill everything with dirt
	River :
		1. Select the tile in the middle of the top row and make it a river tile
		2. Generate a (size x size) noise image used as a gray scale image
		3. Select the three pixels underneath the position of the last tile select
			For example : if the last tile selected was on position (5, 4), the three
			tiles now selected are on position (4, 5), (5, 5) and (6, 5)
		4. Compare the grayscale value of these pixels and keep the position of the highest
			value
		5. Sets the tile selected as a river
		6. Repeat from 3 until the bottom of the tilemap
	Bridge :
		Select the 3 tiles in the middle of the river and turn it into bridge tiles
	Village :
		Place a village in a random position in the bottom part of the tilemap
	Dungeon :
		Place a village in a random position in the top part of the tilemap. Replace
		the dungeon if it falls into the river or too near from the village
	Borders :
		Place water tiles all around the level
